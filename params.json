We will fetch the price, image, image ALT attribute and product name from Walmart.com.\r\n\r\nWe are going to use [Nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri) for Screen-scraping, which can parse HTML and XML documents and extract content from them. Nokogiri is fast, it feels like we’re working more directly on the HTML document rather than doing everything through a DSL.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* [Nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri)\r\n* [SelectorGadget](http://www.selectorgadget.com/)\r\n* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)\r\n\r\n### Author and Contributors\r\nThis project is not done yet,it needs attention and care. I will revisit this project for adding and modifying it's features.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
